# The Cat Pedigree Model for Classifying and Predicting Breeds of the Cats.

The CatPedigree - Cat Dating App uses Machine Learning to classify and predict Cat Breeds. The model were build using TensorFlow Convolutional Neural Network.

End Goal: Take a photo of a cat and gain their respective breed and information about them (fun fact, tips and tricks, how popular they are, etc)
.


## What's in this repo?

* images/ (soon) - folder with sample of cat images
* cp_preprocessing_data.py - Python script that collects the photos from the post-cleaned dataset and split them into train/test directories automatically respective to their train/test split proportion.

* requirements.txt - A text file with the dependency requirements for this project.

## Timeline and Master Plan

As of: 24 May 2022 (Since this documentation is written)
Note: might likely to change.

### Stage 1 (done)
Gathering the dataset. We also clean the dataset for each breeds to remove unrelated or corrupted images to avoid overfit/underfit or even worst model performance. We need to store images at large scale, using Google Storage and Google Drive to store the dataset and accessible to the CatPedigree ML Team.

### Stage 2 (on progress)


### Stage 3 - Build the model prototype
